Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class represents a game, where players can perform all these actions. They can grab, drop, or use an item. They can examine an item as well, and if the item is one of the things listed in the pre-set map, it will give the player a description of that item. Otherwise, it will tell the player that there is nothing special about the item. Players can also walk in specific directions and fly to specific coordinates. Their size can grow or shrink. Most actions can be undone. 

These actions can be performed. However, there are areas of improvement to be made, such as storing all actions in an ArrayList can be helpful. I would recommend future students to be creative and enjoy this assignment!
